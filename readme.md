# Cookie Monster App

This application is created for the purpose of demonstration of implementing CRUD in C# Web API. This application was developed using Visual Studio Code, and therefore have to be adjusted if you'd like to run in Visual Studio

### Setup and Running Instruction
1. Create a new SQL database with name CookieMonster
2. Update connection string located at appsettings.json according to assigned database
3. Run the content of SqlSchemaAndData.sql in SSMS under database CookieMonster
4. Run the web API and go to http://localhost:5000/swagger to test the API functionalities (you don't have to use POSTMAN)

### Functional feature that haven't been implemented
- Paging feature when retrieving all cookies

### Non functional features that haven't been implemented
- Unit Testing
- Logging (I usually using NLog)

Thank you.
